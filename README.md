# DAY in the LIFE of an Astronomer

This workshop is a part of the programme InnovateHER held at the University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. In this workshop, students aged 9-12 years are going to be given a very basic introduction to tools used by professional astronomers for their research, particularly using DS9 for astronomical imaging and using Python for point source identification in an astronomical image (see [notebook](notebook link)).

The students will be provided with laptops with DS9 preinstalled and will use the image of the galaxy M66 (NGC 3627) from the James Webb Space Telescope to initiate discussions on various astronomical concepts, from supermassive blackholes, stars, to extraterrestrial life. 

Then, they will be given a brief demonstration of how I employ point source identification for my research. For the sake of understanding, a lot of the code has been set to default so that more emphasis can be put on the why's and the how's in astronomy rather than the code explanation. 

To access the resources on the cloud, please use the binder link above which will open the resources in a new window where you can use the code interactively.
